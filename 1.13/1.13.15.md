Here are some simple tips to keep in mind when you receive an email that seems suspicious.

1. 📧 "Check the sender's email address. Make sure it matches the official website or organization's domain."
2. 💡 "Look for spelling and grammar mistakes. Scammers often make errors in their emails."
3. 🔒 "Never share personal information, like your Social Security number or bank details, via email."
4. 🤔 "Be cautious of urgent requests for money. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you."
5. 🚫 "Don't click on links or download attachments from unknown senders."
6. 🧐 "When in doubt, call the organization directly using a trusted phone number, not one provided in the email."
